        <div style="text-align :center">Congratulations, you solved this challenge!
            <br/>
            <br/> To do that, you probably exploited an SQL injection to access the members area. If you didn't, you should, that's more fun ;).
            <br /> Then, you exploited a XXE vulnerability - XML eXternal Entity.
            <br /> This vulnerability is little known, hence it can potentially be found in an amazing number of applications that are not yet aware of this threat.
            <br />
            <br/>
            <br/> A lot of applications include XML files, such as RSS files, with not control, and are thus vulnerable!
            <br /> To avoid this vulnerability, you have to indicate to the parser that it musn't allow external entities.
            <br /> On PHP, you can do that with libxml_disable_entity_loader(TRUE);
            <br />
            <br/> Finally, here is your flag: <span class="bold">XMLeXternalEntity_roXXE_</span>
